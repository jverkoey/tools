# Changes that don't need review

If a diff fits neatly into the following categories then you are not **required** to send the code out for review. You're still encouraged to send changes out for review if you'd like additional input or have questions.

1. **Experiments**: Anything in an experiments repo.
2. **Small prose**: Small diffs solely affecting prose. Larger diffs should go out for for typographic/grammatical/comprehension review.
3. **Tooling**: Anything that is strictly related to tooling. E.g. .gitignore, editor configuration settings, linter warnings.
