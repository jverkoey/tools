# Issues/bugs/feature requests

We host all of our issues on GitHub.

## Labels

We use two categories of label: `flow` and `type`.

Every issue must have at least one label from each category.

- [See example of our labels](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-team/labels)

## Milestones and our roadmap

We use GitHub milestones to plan our tasks. We use our Discord channel to plan out longer-term roadmaps.

Each project has a "Next release" milestone. We cut releases on Wednesdays each week.

### Next release

The "Next release" milestone defines what we're focused on for the next release.
