# GitHub issue flow

This article describes a flow for taking ownership of GitHub issues.

## Assignment is ownership

If an issue is assigned to you, it is assumed that you are actively working on the issue.

The inversion of this assumption is important: if you are not working on an issue, **please unassign yourself from it**.

We will periodically remove assignees from issues that do not appear to have progressed. Don't be alarmed; you can always re-assign the issue in the future once you begin work on the issue.

## Post updates early and often

Regular communication is paramount when working in a distributed open source team. We want to avoid [cookie-licking](http://communitymgt.wikia.com/wiki/Cookie_Licking) whenever possible, so we encourage posting to issues early and often.

Some recommendations on communicating early and often:

**I've started working on the issue**

Explain your plan, what considerations you're making, and how long you expect the work to take.

This is also usually when you'd assign the issue to yourself.

**I've gotten stuck, help!**

Explain how you got stuck, what alternatives you're considering, and whether you need help (use `@` mentions to ask for help).

**Randomly**

Random updates to the issue are a helpful way to let others know that the issue is being worked on.
