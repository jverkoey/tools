# Communicating early and often

This article describes how the Material Motion team manages priorities and ongoing work as a distributed open source project. This article is written for anyone who's interested in or actively helping out with a material motion project.

Frequent communication is paramount when working in a distributed open source team. Because our team is not located in one geographical location, we make heavy use of **distributed** workflow principles.

## Assignment is ownership

If an issue is assigned to you, it is assumed that you are actively working on the issue.

The inversion of this assumption is important: if you are not working on an issue, **please unassign yourself from it**.

We will periodically remove assignees from issues that do not appear to have progressed. Don't be alarmed; you can always re-assign the issue in the future once you begin work on the issue. We do this simply to avoid [cookie-licking](http://communitymgt.wikia.com/wiki/Cookie_Licking).

## Post updates to issues early and often

We encourage posting to issues early and often. This has many noticeable effects:

- Combats [cookie-licking](http://communitymgt.wikia.com/wiki/Cookie_Licking).
- Encourages asking for help.
- Helps avoid getting "lost in the weeds".

Some recommendations on communicating early and often:

**I've started working on the issue**

Explain your plan, what considerations you're making, and how long you expect the work to take.

This is also usually when you'd assign the issue to yourself.

**I'm considering changing the direction of my work**

It's rare that an issue is perfectly defined. When you find yourself changing the scope of what you're working on (I need this new tool; this bug has bigger ramifications; I need to try a completely new approach), post to the issue.

**I've started working on something else**

Context switching happens. When it happens, post to the issue. If you expect to be focusing on something else for a while, unassign yourself. This allows anyone else to start where you left off.

**I've gotten stuck, help!**

Explain how you got stuck, what alternatives you're considering, and whether you need help (use `@` mentions to ask for help).

**Randomly**

Random updates to the issue are a helpful way to let others know that the issue is being worked on. We encourage sharing emoji stories.

## Label flow

We use `flow:` labels to communicate the current state of an issue. See [our team repo's labels](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-team/labels).

Flow labels move through the following process:

## Label type

We also use labels to categorize the "type" of an issue. Types we use:

- Bug
- Documentation
- Feature request
- Internal cleanup
- Process
- Question
- Visual bug
- Working as intended
