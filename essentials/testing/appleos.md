# appleOS

We use Xcode unit tests for test our library code.

## Running tests

Travis CI tests our pull requests.

Regular and core team contributors can use `arc` to run unit tests locally.

    arc unit # Run unit tests only if source was affected
    arc unit --everything # Run all unit tests for everything

## Writing tests
