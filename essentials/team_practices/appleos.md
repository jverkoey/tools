## Code style: Objective-C

We use clang-format to automatically format our Objective-C code. See the .clang-format file contained at the root of any Objective-C repository for the set of options we use.

## File system structure

We use a file system convention based on [Google's GOS-conventions.](https://github.com/google/GOS-conventions) At this time, all files should be prefixed with 'MDM.'

## Supported Swift version

We use Swift 3.
