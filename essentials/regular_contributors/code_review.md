# Code review

For core and regular contributors, use [Phabricator](http://codereview.cc/) for all code reviews.

Send all code for review via `arc diff`. If you're creating a new repo then you can run our github yeoman generator like so:

    mkdir new-repo
    cd new-repo
    yo mm-github

This will create the scaffolding `.arc` and open source licensing files. See the bottom of this article for help installing our yeoman generators.
