# Branches

Primary development branch: **develop**

Primary stable branch: **stable**

Develop features locally on feature branches. Use `arc feature <name>` to start a new feature branch pointing at origin/develop. Do not push feature branches to GitHub, unless you're pushing to your own fork.

We will reserve branches in the primary repos for critical fixes and feature work.
