# Team goals

We use the [Starmap](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/) to guide our ongoing development.

As a team we **operate in the open**.

Our general philosophy:

- Elevate existing solutions. Avoid re-inventing wheels.
- In the absence of existing solutions, build great ones.
- Add more ideas to the Starmap as drafts, flesh them out, and then encourage their development across applicable platforms.
- List solutions in the Starmap's [Community index](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/community_index/).
