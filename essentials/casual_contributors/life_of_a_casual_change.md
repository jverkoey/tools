# Life of a casual change

We encourage casual contributors to open GitHub pull requests to make changes.

Guides on pull requests:

- [Using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

## Code review

A frequent or core contributor will review your pull request. You may be asked to make changes to your pull request.

Once a pull request is approved by a frequent or core contributor, the pull request is squashed and merged into the **develop** branch. Your change will land in the next release when the develop branch is merged into the **stable** branch.
