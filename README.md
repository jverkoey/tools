# Material Motion team documents

Welcome to the Material Motion's team documentation. This is the central place to learn about how we operate as a team and as a community.

The [Starmap](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/) describes our long-term, multi-year goals.

We plan our weekly milestones and roadmap on Discord. [Join our channel](https://discord.gg/AJbyYDf).
