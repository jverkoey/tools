## Hackweek summary

The core team met in San Francisco last week for an in-person hackathon. Here's the summary of things we explored:

- Composability of plans/performers. [Read the spec](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/specifications/runtime/performer-composition.html).
- Tossable demo built for Android and iOS.
- Draggable demo built for Web.
- Expanding cards interaction for iOS.
- Implementation of an animation using Material Motion in a Swift Playground.

Composability is the highlight of the week. This feature is what will allow us to create platform-agnostic motion families.

📝 Drafting the [Motion family](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/specifications/motion-family.html) and [Serialization](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/specifications/serialization.html) spec.

📝 Drafting the [Gesturable](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/specifications/motion_family/gesturable.html) motion family.

📝 Defining our tech stack and ownership areas. The goal is to ensure that we have discrete areas of ownership for new team members.

**Bridge motion families** are libraries that allow material motion users to incorporate existing platform animation and interaction libraries.

**Material motion families** are our platform-agnostic libraries.
