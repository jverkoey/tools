## Starmap

🎉 **Tween motion family** spec stabilized. [Read the spec](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/specifications/motion_family/tween.html).

🎉 **Scheduler** tracing spec stabilized. [Read the spec](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/specifications/runtime/scheduler_tracing.html).

🎉 **Transaction** removed from the Runtime. Runtime now simply consists of Scheduler, Plan, and Performer types.

## Android platform

📝 **Rebound motion family** Iterating toward MVP.

## Apple platforms

📝 **Tween motion family** Iterating toward MVP.

📝 **POP motion family** Iterating toward MVP.

📝 **Direct manipulation motion family** Iterating toward MVP.

🎉 **Runtime** Transaction object removed. Greatly simplifies usage of the runtime.

## Web frameworks

📝 **Direct manipulation motion family** 

- Built [prototype](codepen.io/appsforartists/full/PGjGEr) of gesture streams (which will power the Direct Manipulation motion family).
- Added TypeScript annotations.  ([diff](http://codereview.cc/D1692))

📝 **Release workflow** 

- Discovered [tsickle](https://github.com/angular/tsickle), a TypeScript to Closure JSDoc tool maintained by the Angular team.
- Fixed a [bug that prevented](https://github.com/angular/tsickle/pull/238) the open-source version from compiling Material Motion.
- Became a maintainer of the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsickle).  Going forward, Material Motion can ensure and verify that the open-source version of tsickle maintains parity with the internal version.
