# Team practices

## Line length

For code, we enforce a loose 100 character line length. Be reasonable.

For documentation we enforce a strict 100 character line length. We prefer narrow columns of dense text.

The exception to the above is GitBook markdown. The GitBook editor is designed as a what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor. Each "line" in GitBook markdown is a paragraph, and therefor has no artificial line length.
