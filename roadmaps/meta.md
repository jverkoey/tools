# Meta Roadmap

This Roadmap defines the milestones we broadly want to achieve together as a team.

## Starmap milestones

1. Primitives.
3. Expressions.
2. Patterns.
3. Runtimes.
4. Applications.
5. Languages.

## Starmap implementation milestones

1. Tween Language available on Android, Web, and iOS.
1. Gesture Language available on Android, Web, and iOS.
1. Physical Simulation Language available on Android, Web, and iOS.
1. Motion Runtime available on Android, Web, and iOS.

## Platform-specific milestones

### Android

1. Physical simulation integrator.


# NOTES

## Priorities

Potential rough order of priorities.

- Language
- Intention language on various platforms
  - Android
  - Swift
  - Objective-C
- Validate director intention actor metaphor on the web
- Definition of Runtime
- Runtime
- Tween intentions driven by Timeline
- Squishable demo

What is our MVP?

- Android: have a working Runtime
- Integrate apps long before a 1.0
- Working in the open: "We are an experiment!" no such thing as too early/too late?
- Don't just publicize an empty repo.
  - Difference between publicize and having code in the open.
- Provide something to rally around.
- Do we want public to create new concepts? Or to work on what's already there.
- May not want to write full 1.0 and then publish.

How does someone new to the Starmap learn how to use solutions?
How does someone share thoughts to a designer and vice/versa?

- When do we bake a language?
- When do we define higher level exit/entry language?

Measurements of success:

- Lines of code reduction
- Time investment
-
