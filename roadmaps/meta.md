# Meta Roadmap

This Roadmap defines the milestones we broadly want to achieve together as a team.

## Starmap milestones

Next goal: Lock down Primitives and Expressions chapters.

Actively being worked on: Runtimes and Languages.

## Director milestones

The following Directors represent minimum levels of expression we'd like to achieve.

### Squishable

1. Physical simulation integrator.


# NOTES

## Priorities

Potential rough order of priorities.

- Language
- Intention language on various platforms
  - Android
  - Swift
  - Objective-C
- Validate director intention actor metaphor on the web
- Definition of Runtime
- Runtime
- Tween intentions driven by Timeline
- Squishable demo

What is our MVP?

- Android: have a working Runtime
- Integrate apps long before a 1.0
- Working in the open: "We are an experiment!" no such thing as too early/too late?
- Don't just publicize an empty repo.
  - Difference between publicize and having code in the open.
- Provide something to rally around.
- Do we want public to create new concepts? Or to work on what's already there.
- May not want to write full 1.0 and then publish.

How does someone new to the Starmap learn how to use solutions?
How does someone share thoughts to a designer and vice/versa?

- When do we bake a language?
- When do we define higher level exit/entry language?

Measurements of success:

- Lines of code reduction
- Time investment
-
