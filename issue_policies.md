# Issue policies

## Labels

We use two categories of label: `flow` and `type`. Every issue must have at least one label from each category.

- [See example of our labels](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-team/labels)

## Milestones

We use milestones to plan out our work.

Each project has a "Next release" milestone.
