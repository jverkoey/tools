# GitBook etiquette

GitBook does not have pull requests. By default, changes are made to the `master` branch for the book.

## Making minor edits

If you intend to make minor edits, feel free to do so on the master branch. Use good judgment.

## Making major edits

Create a branch for major edits. You can create a branch by following these steps:

- Edit the book of interest.
- Click the "branch" drop-down in the top right of the GitBook web user interface.
- Select "New branch"
- Name the branch.

Once you've created a branch you can freely make changes on it. Your branch is now on its own.

## Handling conflicts

If GitBook detects a conflict when attempting to merge two branches it will open [the conflict resolution](https://www.gitbook.com/blog/features/merge-conflicts) page.
