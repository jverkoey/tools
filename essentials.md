# Essentials

## Communication

We hang out on Discord. The channel is presently private.

All of our work lives in the [material-motion](https://github.com/material-motion) organization on GitHub.

## Team goals

For each of the ideas explored in the [Starmap](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/):

- Elevate existing solutions so that we can avoid re-inventing wheels.
- In the absence of existing solutions, build great ones.
- List solutions in the Starmap's [Community](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/community/) chapter.

For ourselves as a team:

- Operate in the open.

## Tools we use

- [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) for document authoring (like this one!)
- GitHub for code authoring ([material-motion](https://github.com/material-motion) is our org)
- git for all version tracking.

### Android

- Android Studio 2.1

### Objective-C/Swift

- Xcode 7.3.
- Swift 2.2.

## GitBook etiquette

GitBook does not have pull requests. By default, changes are made to the `master` branch for the book.

### Releasing

We will periodically publish "releases" of our books. This means that the `master` branch is able to be in a perpetual state of drafting.

### Making minor edits

If you intend to make minor edits, feel free to do so on the master branch. Use good judgement.

### Making major edits

Create a branch for major edits. You can create a branch by following these steps:

- Edit the book of interest.
- Click the "branch" dropdown in the top right of the GitBook web UI.
- Select "New branch"
- Name the branch.

Once you've created a branch you can freely make changes on it. Your branch is now on its own.

#### Pulling in the latest changes

Changes may land in master while you're working on your branch. To update your branch with these latest changes you can merge `master` into your branch.

To do so, select the "branch" dropdown menu and select "Merge branches". Merge **from** master **to** your branch.
