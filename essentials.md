# Essentials

## Communication

We hang out on Discord. The channel is presently private.

All of our work lives in the [material-motion](https://github.com/material-motion) organization on GitHub.

## Team goals

- Elevate existing solutions so that we can avoid re-inventing wheels.
- In the absence of existing solutions, build great solutions for the ideas explored in the [Starmap](https://featherless.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/).
- Operate in the open.
