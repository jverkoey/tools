# Essentials

## Communication

We hang out on Discord. The channel is presently private.

All of our work lives in the [material-motion](https://github.com/material-motion) organization on GitHub.

## Team goals

For each of the ideas explored in the [Starmap](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/):

- Elevate existing solutions so that we can avoid re-inventing wheels.
- In the absence of existing solutions, build great ones.
- Add solutions to the Starmap's [Community](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/community/) chapter.

For ourselves as a team:

- Operate in the open.
